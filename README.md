**QRoute** /'kyooâ€¢root/ - *n* - Declarative *walking* router for UI navigation.

  - human readable composition of complex navigation hierarchies
  - automatic pathfinding between routes
  - declarative, test-friendly solution for driving view navigation
  - compatible with any kind of navigation
  - mediation of input dependencies

The QRoute walking router is specifically designed to handle situations where you have
a hierarchical arrangement of scenes, pages, windows, or views, and you need a clean,
declarative way in which to define, orchestrate, and drive sweeping, multi-step
navigation routines.

QRoute will determine the nearest path and then `drive` your custom `resolvers`
*(the components that integrate with your particular UI navigation framework)*,
asynchronously invoking them in the correct order, until finally arriving at the
destination.
